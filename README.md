Code for extracting a representative image from a PDF file using CV.

This code needs to be run on GPU. We include a colab example.

## Setup

```bash setup.sh```


## Running 

First add a bunch of PDF files to a directory `pdfs/`. 

Next call,  

```python run.py pdfs/ pics/ ```

The code will attempt to extract an image for each pdf into the pic directory. 

Thanks to Anirudh Dagar and Victor Zuanazzi for testing it out.
